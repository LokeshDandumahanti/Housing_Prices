# Housing_Prices

Hi. I am Lokesh Dandumahanti and today I am going to present my project of House price prediction under a mega-project of concept “Revolutionizing Real Estate: Making Buying and Renting as simple as Trading Stocks”. For this project I have taken Bengaluru Housing Data as training data. 


In this project, by integrating the machine learning model trained on modified bhv training dataset into a webapp interface, we are simplifying the process of estimating house price rates according to multiple paramaters which can be adjusted by user according to their needs.
